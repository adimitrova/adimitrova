I am a highly positive and motivated professional, extremely curious, and therefore, always super-motivated to learn and explore new tech. I am open to challenges, initiative, and truly enjoy puzzle-solving via code. I highly value the quality in writing code as well as following the engineering excellence standards (best practices) to ensure robustness, stability, consistency, and therefore peace of mind. I appreciate open-minded and honest people, constructive feedback, and the autonomy to do my job in the best possible way.. and together with my hedgehog :) 
In fact, we are a dream team of a hedgehog and his human, whereas the human is doing the work while the hedgehog mostly sleeps and gives moral support. 💪 Together we achieve the perfect work-life balance, he "does" the life, I do the work =)
